# Mars Rover Project 

## Overview
The Mars Rover project simulates the movement and navigation of rovers on a Martian plateau. The rovers can be positioned on a grid, turned, and moved forward based on a series of instructions. The simulation checks if the rover's new positions are within the boundaries of the plateau.

## Features
* Define a plateau with specific dimensions.
* Place rovers on the plateau with initial positions and orientations.
* Control rover movement using commands: Left (L), Right (R), and Move Forward (M).
* Ensure rovers do not move outside the plateau boundaries.
* Get the final position and orientation of the rovers after executing commands.

## Technologies Used
* **Java**: Java: Programming language used for implementation.
* **JUnit**: Testing framework used for unit testing.

## Installation
