# Mars Rover Project
This project simulates moving a rover around a plateau. The plateau is defined by a grid size of 5x5 and the rover can be navigated according to given instructions.
## Descripton

Rovers are added to the plateau at specific starting coordinates and face a certain direction: North, East, South, or West.

Rovers can move left (L), right (R) or move forward (M) when facing the current direction. The movement of the Rover can not go outside of the plateau's boundaries.

After all the movements are executed, the final position of the rover is displayed, showing x, y co-ordinates and the direction it is facing.
## Installation
In your terminal, clone the repository to your machine with the command "git clone https://github.com/JannelJ/java-unit.git".
